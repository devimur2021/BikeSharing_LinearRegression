# BikeSharing_LinearRegression

> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
This project effort helps to generate a Linear Regression model to understand the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. The data will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. Based on data management can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Also the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Bike Sharing Linear Regression model is generated to help understand the business dynamics and demand for shared bikes across varied seasons and year

## Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. They would like to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends in American Market.

Company Wants to understand
* Factors predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well the variables describe the bike demands

So, it can come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue.

- Project uses the dataset day.csv and the data dictionary available in Readme.txt

## Approach
Steps followed in the data analysis
* Data Visualization
* Data Preparation
* Modelling
* Evaluation of the model


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 
  Factors affect the Bike Booking are Season , Weather situation on a given day , Working/Non workingday and Year on Year Increase int he booking
- Conclusion 2 
  Variables Temp and ATemp have a colinear relationship
- Conclusion 3 
  Indenpendent factors like Month, Humidity, workinday/Non working day, holiday do not have impact on the count dependent variable
